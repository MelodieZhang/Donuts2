# 003-Dribble-Client
The code is based on a tutorial by AppDesignVault. The videos are at How to make a Dribbble App Part 1.

More to do: 

1. Add UIPopOverViewController to show the images in detail 

2. And Landscape mode and iPad view support 

3. Add Search 4. Add Settings 5. Add Login

Some updates: 

1. Created HttpService class to handle HTTP request, so as to abstract the functions 

2. Created DribbleObjectHandler class to handle the Handle Dribble related function calls. 

3. Add Property Watchers to update the UIView once the datasource is updated. 

4. Cleaned up some of the code.
